# Flutter Doves

Flutter Doves is a themed starter project for new developers in Flutter to experiment with.
The starter app is called "Mourning Dove Aficionados", and is a collection of characterized doves presented in a scrolling list.
Of course, there's no need to keep the theme, but I find it nice when a tutorial/starter project comes with a prompt or theme to propel the learning experience.

## Getting Started

1. [Follow the directions on the Flutter website to set up the SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Install the Dart and Flutter language plugins for Visual Studio Code (Publisher's name is Dart Code)
4. Clone this project to your local machine and open it in Visual Studio Code
5. Launch an Android or iOS simulator
6. Run `flutter doctor`
7. If `flutter doctor` reports all is well, run `flutter run`, and the app should open in your simulator

## How To Run The Project

1. cd to the project directory
2. Launch a simulator
3. `flutter run`

Happy Fluttering!
